I want to create a Python script that will create an MP4 file that shows the flow of traffic through infrastructure to help staff understand the flow of data through the network for various business processes.  

I am learning (relearning) python and some new modules, while also learning github Agent.   THis is a fresh computer, fresh VSCode, fresh Python install, Fresh Git install, Fresh git hub repo... 

Lets see what it can do.  I got some leads from ChatGPT on a python way to do this.. I will share it here. 



Manim Community Edition producing an MP4 or GIF that you embed in Azure DevOps Wiki or SharePoint. 

Here are the requirements, end to end.

Software you need on the machine that renders the animation
    Python  (installed using Microsoft Store)
    Manim Community | Documentation  (installed using pip)
    FFmpeg (installed using github agent)
        Also Installed:
            choco
            git
    ManimPango (installed using GitHub Agent, on this install the Agent recommended a .venv which I accepted.)
    LaTeX (Optional)
